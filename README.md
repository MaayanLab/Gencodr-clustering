# Encodr-clustering

Uses [Gencodr](https://github.com/MaayanLab/Gencodr) to embed a gmt's genesets into a latent space for visualization.

The weights of the VAE model should be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j1Ck1FsRnCCwu7Q_X32NurhYdwCZP9JJ/view?usp=sharing), because they exceed Github's file size limits.
